To do list for the Dec 1-5 ARTN Engineering Run

1. Establish easy setup procedure with minimum manual changing of parameters in artn-mon.  Document on the github page.
2. Test out dithering for an image sequence.  Document.
3.  Communicate target names from the RTS2 queue to image header so the images get that name in the header field rather than "RTS2."
3a.  This can be expanded to a more general request:  We need to figure out all the header keywords we want populated as a medium-term task; I'd argue we won't totally know this until we know how we're going to archive, reduce and distribute the data.  In the meantime, it would be good to have a clear recipe for adding in header keywords via RTS2.
4. Need to figure out why the AzCam and BIG61 drivers sometimes lose communication, and 1) have a way of detecting when this happens / issuing a warning; 2) friendly way of restarting driver ideally without stopping RTS2 and the queue; 3) fix it so it doesn't happen.
5. Progress towards automatically taking: autofocus / flats / standards / etc.
6.  Test Ben's script for adding a target to the rts queue.
7. Work on making filter identification robust for ARTN use.
