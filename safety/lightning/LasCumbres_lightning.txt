Hi Dave,

The by-the-book method would be to follow the guidelines in the NFPA
780: Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems.
It basically recommends setting up lightning rods at certain heights
above what you want to protect to create zones of protection.

We ended up not doing that and decided that we have a steel dome with
steel walls that creates a decent faraday cage.  There is a buried
ground ring around each dome.  The walls are bonded to the ring and to
ground via the concrete pad (ufer ground).  The dome is bonded to the
ring via cable to slipring brushes that contact the exterior bottom
edge of the dome.  Our other buildings are steel storage containers so
same thing.

Each ground ring is bonded to the other rings at each site.  The only
other galvanic connections between buildings are the power wires.  All
signal is done via fiber.

Also, there are surge protection devices (SPD) in each panel that
receives or sends power at each building.  It's much more common to
experience surge events from lightning via the incoming mains power
than to actually have your building get hit by lightning so this is
quite important.  The SPD's on the mains should be a heavy duty type
and then the farther down your power system the SPD's can be a lighter
duty.

I hope that helps, I'm glad to answer any further questions.

Regards,
