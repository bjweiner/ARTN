Yes, we have detailed procedures for lightning shutdowns.
I'll send them to you.  They involve shutting down and
unplugging the cameras and most of the computers as well
as throwing some breakers.  We leave our gateway machines
and weather station computer up for convenience, relying
on the surge protectors and the UPSes.  In 35 years of
operation we've had about 3 lightning events that cost us
about $10K-$20K total to replace equipment.

Just checked old email; we've had about 6 episodes of lightning
damage since 1983.  Total replacement cost ~$20K.  The equipment
that gets damaged, even when 110 vac cords are unplugged, are
things like comm cards in computers, devices on long signal cables,
phone lines, etc.  We do not unplug all the comms and signal 
cables because there are too many of them and some have many delicate 
pins and/or elaborate RF shields that don't take cycling in & out
too well, especially by non-engineer observers.  In recent times
we've tried to install fiber optic media converters and opto
isolators wherever possible.  We also protect our branch service
panels with those pricey wall-mounted Transtector(R) surge protectors
as well as those cheapo sacrificial MOVs across the input
voltage.  But we've still had damage to soft electronics by induced
currents.

The biggest loss to lightning at an observatory that I know about
occurred at Wyoming in 1978.  They had unplugged everything, but
the current induced in a coiled-up 110 vac power cord by the
magnetic flux from a strike fried everything in a whole rack
of electronics.

The (new?) Mt. Hopkins practice of not unplugging anything will
not end well.  I can only guess that their engineers are young
& inexperienced.  The great difficulty with lightning damage
is that some circuits are only weakened and not put out of
action right away.  The effects of lightning can persist as
intermittent mysterious problems for months after, draining
manpower to track down.  State of AZ Risk Mgmt also has a high
deductible threshold now on insurance reimbursement for lightning
damage.  When you can get reimbursed, you only get the depreciated
value of the equipment and can't use the money for anything
except an exact replacement.  

Good luck!
