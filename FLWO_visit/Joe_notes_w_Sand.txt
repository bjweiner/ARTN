These are a collection of Joe's great notes from the FLWO visit, with
some Sand flavor.  Most of this pertains to the robotic 48-in

#############
General Operation
#############

Almost always run in robotic mode, although it is used classically one
week per year by a Harvard astro class.

#############
Weather, Safety & Security
#############

They use security codes/pads for security.  Not much beyond this, and
not too much human safety.

They do not get a lot of foot traffic -- certainly less than Bigelow.

No real lightning shutdown procedure.  Although they do have a 30 ft. lightning rod next door, and rods on the dome.  The also try to not use copper in favor of optical fiber whenever possible.

There is always an operator next door at the 60-in -- this person
intervenes if something goes wrong.

They use an Aurora weather station rather than a Boltwood -- they say
the sky temperature is more reliable and thhat they use this as a
factor in weather shutdowns.


############
Calibration
############

Take both dome and twilight flats, robotically.

Standard star data also seems to be taken robotically on a regular basis.

They monitor the sky brightness quite closely, in conjunction with the
local copper mine.  This seems more like a hobby of Emilio's.

############
Archive and Data Reduction
############

Archive data at the CfA at the end of the night; nothing in real time.

No data reduction is done, but all calibration data is provided.

Almost no data quality assurance -- would rely on user feed back.
