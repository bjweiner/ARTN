These are a collection of Joe's great notes from the FLWO visit, with
some Sand flavor.  Most of this pertains to the robotic 48-in

#############
General Operation
#############

Almost always run in robotic mode, although it is used classically one
week per year by a Harvard astro class.

RTS2 is the heart of the operation.  They seem to use some GUIs that
are useful that we do not currently use.

They have a single imager as their instrument. They do run the guider
along side it, using RTS2.

They actively cool the mirror to ambient via 26 sensors.

They auto fill the dewar, and it runs on a timer.  We should do this!

#############
Weather, Safety & Security
#############

They use security codes/pads for security.  Not much beyond this, and
not too much human safety.

They do not get a lot of foot traffic -- certainly less than Bigelow.

No real lightning shutdown procedure.  Although they do have a 30
ft. lightning rod next door, and rods on the dome.  The also try to
not use copper in favor of optical fiber whenever possible.

There is always an operator next door at the 60-in -- this person
intervenes if something goes wrong.

They use an Aurora weather station rather than a Boltwood -- they say
the sky temperature is more reliable and thhat they use this as a
factor in weather shutdowns.

The system will send an email alarm if the camera warms up, or if no
data was taken in the last hour.


############
Calibration
############

Take both dome and twilight flats, robotically.

They run a focus routine every night.  Once best focus is found, they
then adjust focus the rest of the night based on the temperature.

Pointing is tuned up nightly using astrometry.net.

Standard star data also seems to be taken robotically on a regular basis.

They monitor the sky brightness quite closely, in conjunction with the
local copper mine.  This seems more like a hobby of Emilio's.


###########
Scheduling & Timekeeping
###########

Mosty nights are still assigned classically.  On your given night, you
VNC into the RTS2 computer and upload your schedule.  If there are
gaps in your night, data is taken from a large pool of backup objects.

They rely on an 'honor system' so that people do not take more time
than they are allocated.  This is barely policed.




############
Archive and Data Reduction
############

Archive data at the CfA at the end of the night; nothing in real time.

No data reduction is done, but all calibration data is provided.

Almost no data quality assurance -- would rely on user feed back.

###########
Known Problems
###########

Very few.  Occasionally the telescope will run into a limit, and must
be recovered by the 60-in operator.
