Joe's slightly annotated notes on ARTN Meeting 06/20/18

1. Review of Previous Run

#############################

We now have a focus routine that works, but we need to make it a robust and routine part of our beginning of the night operations.


################################

Eric and CSS has a focus map for the 61" -- delivered to Sand and now on GitHub page.

They take seven images and the observer identifies the image with the best focus, FWHM

###############################

Discussion of Focus and Homing Focus at the 61"

	Pros versus cons of homing focus

	*** Decided it should be done at the beginning of every night for ARTN

	Greg has ideas of using an absolute encoder

	Currently the observer's responsibility to do so at the start of their run for traditional M4K observing

	*** We should develop a separate "non-flat" procedure at the start of every night which includes homing focus and then setting to "rough" M4K focus value.  In case ARTN opens at a time other than twilight.

#################################	


2. Scheduling


CJ and Scott cannot do 61" June/July because of their commitments to converting the VATT to NG

Peter Milne and David Sand can do July

David will send out an email asking who can observe -- DONE

Note there are two TBS days at the end of June at the 61"

################################


3. 61" Progress Report


Hardware work can be done before hand/before actual ARTN engineering nights

Scott and Greg can work on testing out Greg's hardware during the day before ARTN runs

Greg plans to have mirror covers and dome shutter hardware working for upcoming July run (he was going to have it for late June but nights not scheduled)

Scott will incorporate into RTS2

4. Critical Path List versus Secondary List

--Discussion on use of windscreens at the 61"

	Agreement the windscreens would not be automated to the point of keeping a narrow opening for the telescope to look through

	Windscreens used as an added layer of protection for the telescope versus not using them at all which is what FLWO does

	Have the windscreens open once at the beginning of an ARTN night and then close at the end of the night?

	Windscreen discussion on protection from water, ice, bolts etc over scope versus making the dome shutter seal more secure

	Talk of how water has collected on top of the windscreens in the past.

	Note both upper and lower windscreens operate each night with traditional observing
	
	Windscreens currently stowed at end of every night to protect scope and opened when scope in operation so they get used regularly.

	Greg needs to evaluate the windscreen robustness at the 61", he wants to work with Jim and Jim's crew on this

	Dennis is needed to set the priority and/or need for some of the items for ARTN like windscreen use for ARTN as he is the acting Ops director



--Dome Seeing and Vent Fans

	Why are the fans in the dome out of service?

	Discussion of fans and light leaks, why they are covered up with wood

	One fan vibrates the scope when in service per Greg

	Sand says this is not on the critical path.


--Critical Path List Versus secondary List

	Critical
		windscreens
		elevator
		many others, but not discussed.


###############################

5. SPIE Trip Review

Talk #1
	Eric Saunders Las Cumbres Observatory - leaving observatory

	Transitioning to Python 3 - we should do this for our system; already in progress and should be transparent.
	
	Development of generic interface for RTS2 to other observatories versus idiosyncracies of each observatory called "payload"

	Big Brother - handles telescope with and without RTS2

Talk #2
	Image X 3.0

	Science image archiving tool

	Developed with co-PI named "Avinda"?

	Possible cheap solution to problem

	Sand will ask about NOAO archiving.


###################################


6. Data Archiving Discussion

	CJ - wants to get data to a location on a "shelf". From that point he feels it is up to the astronomers to evaluate/analyze it.  Dave disagrees, but doesn't think CJ+Scott should have to take this on.

	Data Archiving: ARTN needs it. Who does it? Where to put it? We need to work on getting answers to these questions

	ARTN data archiving policy versus Steward traditional observer data archiving policy
	
		Current Steward policy for traditional observers - once leave mountain no guarantee it will be saved

	Open Archive - if we get funding from outside sources the data will need to be available for public consumption at some level.


####################################

7. FLWO Field Trip Review

	Open discussion on highlights

	Lightning Shutdown

	AC/active cooling of dome

	Auto LN2 filling of dewar


	See notes on wiki

####################################

8. Problem Review and Brainstorming

	Transition from CSS Remote to M4K regular problem with loss of guide/drift function in NG. [only tangentially related to ARTN]

		Hand paddle could not move scope
		
		Guider could not move scope

		Why? Quick fix was to power cycle TCS NG which cleared error

	Review problem from CSS Remote to M4K regular with bias rate Betsy could not get rid of
	
		Why?

		Quick fix was to power cycle TCS NG which cleared error

	Discussion of observers power cycling TCS NG at the start of their run - they should do this, it is in instructions

	Region of Interest
		
		If someone really wants this for ARTN (like Apai) the will have to define what they need and write a script to do this -- I have emailed D. Apai about the ROI issue (D. Sand)

		Binning requirements between users (example CSS uses 4x4, regular observers use 3x3)

		What camera parameters will be set when RTS2 starts?

		Scott is going to work on camera driver
