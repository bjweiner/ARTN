ARTN activities and goals for fall 2017

----- 
Consecutive engineering time in fall 2017, not counting TBS -
see detailed list at end.
6  nights in early Oct 
10 nights in early Nov
6  nights in early Dec
4  nights in end Dec/early Jan
4  nights at end Jan
-----

* Activities:

- Petr Kubanek visit.
- Queue scheduling an entire night with RTS2.
- Using RTS2 to carry out astronomical observations.
- Further commissioning of Chimera high speed camera.
- Development of guider interface.
- Work on telescope/facility hardware interface, eg dome.
- Define science and technical requirements for ARTN:
  - for individual facilities
  - for network manager / Big Brother
- Define technical / safety requirements for remote / autonomous 
  operation of ARTN telescopes and Kuiper in particular.

* Needs / resources:

[to be filled out]
Include time estimates for specific tasks.

* Goals / milestones for this semester:

- Demonstrate utility of queue obs by doing regular astronomical
  observations under RTS2 control.
- Have some kind of interface (GUI or text) that allows an observer / 
  scheduler who is not a black belt to set up and control a night's 
  worth of RTS2 queue.
- Flesh out specification/requirements for ARTN and network manager 
  so that development of queue operations on 61" can continue without 
  introducing future incompatibilities / limitations.
