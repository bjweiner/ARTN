we use a yankee chilled mirror hygrometer in the MMT chamber. i
believe it is an MET-2010,
http://www.yesinc.com/products/met-hyg.html. i don’t recall off-hand
what the cost was, but they’re not cheap. i can follow up with barb
russ on monday to see what we paid for it and when. we need to get
another one or something similar to install outside because we also
have the problem of outdoor sensors consistently reading too low. with
a bit of searching i found some other similar devices on the market in
the $2k-3k range plus extra for hardware to enable outdoor use.

i’m currently setting up a rain/condensation detection system using a
pair of hydreon optical rain sensors, http://rainsensors.com/. they’re
only $60 a piece and can be monitored via a raspberry pi or
arduino. other automated observatories wire these devices right into
dome/shutter electronics to trigger closure automatically.

just followed up with will goble about the outdoor chilled mirror
hygrometer he’s spec’ed out for the MMT. he has a quote for an
edgetech 200M,
https://edgetechinstruments.com/product/meteorological-system/, for
just under $8000. our compressed air system also uses a similar
edgetech device and it’s been rock solid for over 25 years.

there are cheaper chilled mirror hygrometers, but none of those i’ve
found are really suited for long-term outdoor use in a harsh
environment…
